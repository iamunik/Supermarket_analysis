<h1 style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px dashed">Supermarket analysis</h1>
This project is an analysis project. I got a dataset for a supermarket store, the very first task was to import the data into the notebook, after importing the data I had to rename the columns and check the data types of each column as well as confirm if there were any missing values, after doing all of that I began the analysis.<br>KPI's were given and I had to perform analysis operations to view the KPI's on the dataset, I had to analyse the relationship between certain columns, perform trend analysis by day and time also to perform Revenue, Cost and Ratings analysis.
